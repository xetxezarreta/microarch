# Simulators for Computer Architecture Research and Education

This document provides an overview of several popular simulators used in computer architecture research and education. Simulators allow researchers and students to model and evaluate different hardware designs and configurations without needing to build physical prototypes. They provide a flexible and cost-effective way to explore the performance and behavior of computer systems under various workloads.

## Overview of Key Simulators

The following simulators are commonly used for a range of computer architecture studies, from low-level microarchitectural analysis to full-system evaluation:

### 1. gem5

*   **Description:** gem5 is a modular, open-source, full-system simulator platform widely used in academia and industry. It's considered the *de facto* standard for many computer architecture research projects due to its flexibility, extensibility, and active community.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Full-System Simulation:**  gem5 can simulate an entire computer system, including the CPU, memory system, I/O devices, and even the operating system.  This allows for realistic performance evaluation of software running on simulated hardware.
    *   **Multiple ISAs:** Supports multiple instruction set architectures (ISAs), including ARM, x86, RISC-V, Alpha, and SPARC.
    *   **Multiple CPU Models:** Provides a variety of CPU models, ranging from simple in-order pipelines to complex out-of-order execution models with detailed branch prediction and cache hierarchies.  These include:
        *   **AtomicSimpleCPU:** A very simple CPU model that executes one instruction at a time.  Useful for debugging and understanding basic simulator functionality.
        *   **TimingSimpleCPU:**  A simple in-order CPU model with timing considerations.
        *   **MinorCPU:** A detailed, configurable in-order CPU model.
        *   **O3CPU:** A highly detailed out-of-order CPU model, often used for research.
    *   **Flexible Memory System:** Offers a highly configurable memory system, including support for various cache coherence protocols, memory controllers, and DRAM models (e.g., DDR3, DDR4, LPDDR4, HBM). The `classic` memory system and newer `Ruby` memory system allow simulation of a range of cache hierarchies.
    *   **Extensible:** gem5's modular design allows users to easily add new components or modify existing ones. This is facilitated by its Python configuration scripts.
    *   **Active Community:** A large and active community provides support, documentation, and contributions.
    *   **Stats System:** Built in statistics collection framework.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Evaluating new CPU architectures and microarchitectures.
    *   Studying the impact of memory system design on performance.
    *   Developing and testing new operating system features.
    *   Analyzing the performance of different software workloads.
    *   Security research (e.g., evaluating side-channel attacks).
*   **Essential Status:** *Essential* for serious computer architecture research due to its comprehensive capabilities and widespread adoption.

### 2. ChampSim

*   **Description:** ChampSim is a trace-based simulator primarily designed for research on cache hierarchies and branch predictors.  It's significantly faster than full-system simulators like gem5 because it doesn't simulate the entire system.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Trace-Based:** ChampSim uses instruction traces as input.  A trace is a record of the instructions executed by a program, including memory addresses accessed.  This avoids the need to simulate instruction fetching and decoding.
    *   **Focus on Cache and Branch Prediction:** Optimized for simulating caches (L1, L2, LLC) and branch predictors.  It allows researchers to quickly evaluate different designs without the overhead of full-system simulation.
    *   **Used in Competitions:** ChampSim is the simulator used in the Data Prefetching Championship (DPC) and the Cache Replacement Championship (CRC), fostering research in these areas.
    *   **Relatively Easy to Use:**  Simpler to set up and use compared to gem5, making it suitable for introductory projects and rapid prototyping.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Cache replacement policy research.
    *   Branch predictor design and evaluation.
    *   Data prefetching research.
    *   Studying the interaction between caches and branch predictors.
*   **Limitations:** Because it's trace-based, ChampSim doesn't capture the dynamic behavior of the CPU pipeline or the effects of operating system interactions. It cannot be used for research that depends on such behaviors.

### 3. MARSSx86

*   **Description:** MARSSx86 (Micro-Architectural System Simulator for x86) is a full-system simulator specifically designed for the x86 architecture. It combines a cycle-accurate CPU simulator (based on PTLsim) with a QEMU-based system emulator.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **x86 Focus:**  Specifically tailored for simulating x86 systems, making it suitable for research targeting this widely used architecture.
    *   **Full-System Simulation:**  Simulates the entire system, including the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
    *   **Cycle-Accurate CPU Model:**  Provides a cycle-accurate model of the CPU pipeline, allowing for detailed performance analysis.
    *   **QEMU Integration:**  Uses QEMU for system emulation, providing support for running unmodified operating systems and applications.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   x86 microarchitecture research.
    *   Performance analysis of x86-based systems.
    *   Low-level systems research (e.g., operating system modifications).

### 4. SimpleScalar

*   **Description:** SimpleScalar is an older, but still valuable, simulator suite for computer architecture education and research. It provides a set of tools for simulating a MIPS-like processor at various levels of detail.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Multiple Simulators:** Includes several simulators, ranging from a functional simulator (sim-safe) to a detailed, cycle-accurate simulator (sim-outorder).
    *   **MIPS-like ISA:** Uses a simplified, MIPS-like instruction set architecture.
    *   **Widely Used in Education:**  Often used in computer architecture courses due to its relative simplicity and well-documented code.
    *   **Outdated:** While still useful for learning the basics, SimpleScalar is less actively maintained and may not be suitable for cutting-edge research.  gem5 has largely superseded it.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Introductory computer architecture education.
    *   Understanding basic processor concepts.
    *   Simple microarchitecture experiments.
*   **Limitations:** Limited ISA support, less detailed models compared to gem5, and less active development.
